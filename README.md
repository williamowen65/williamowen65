### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on applying my new found skills to real life projects that I have envisioned in my head. I'm excited to one day share with you projects that I can call - my pride and joy. For right now I have a few project with which I can show off. These projects are stepping stones to my goals...

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the benfits of Netlify and putting a lot of thought into my workflow so that I can actually reach my goals. On my horizon is one codebase to rule them all. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects, including allowing others on my own. Look through these repos to see if you would be interested in contributing.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help getting intrigrated with the social network of developers. The reality is that I have been working alone as a learn this whole time.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects. Each is fun, unique, and some are visionary. 

âš¡ Fun fact: Tidal locking prevents us from ever seeing the dark side of the moon.
